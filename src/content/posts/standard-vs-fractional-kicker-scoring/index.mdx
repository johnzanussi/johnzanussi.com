## Intro

My childhood friends and I have been in a competitive fantasy football league for the past 12 years. While I've accepted that fantasy football is mostly luck, it's a good reason to continue the long-lived text thread with my idiot friends and makes watching football on Sundays that much more enjoyable (or stressful). Especially as a Giants fan these days.

For the 2024 season, my league switched from standard to fractional scoring for kickers. Once the regular season ended a few weeks ago, I was interested how much of an impact the change had on scoring. So, I dusted off my coding skills and compiled the data from each starting kicker in our league to see if I could answer my questions and maybe uncover other insights. I'm by no means a data analyst, but I think the info is interesting enough to share.

## Standard vs Fractional Scoring

Yahoo's standard kicker scoring looks like this:

| Field Goal Yards | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| 0-19             | 3      |
| 20-29            | 3      |
| 30-39            | 3      |
| 40-49            | 4      |
| 50+              | 5      |

Fractional scoring assigns .1 point for each yard. So while a **62-yard** field goal increases from **5** points to **6.2** points, a **21-yard** field goal decreases from **3** points to **2.1** points.

## Baseline Stats

*Based on a 12-team, 14-week regular season.*

|                        |        |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Total Kickers Used** | 22     |
| **Total Yards Kicked** | 12,210 |
| **Total Field Goals**  | 313    |
| **Average Field Goals per Week** | 22.4 |
| **Average Yards Kicked per Week** | 872.1 |

## Initial Questions

Before gathering and analyzing the data, I had the following initial questions, which I was able to answer:

#### Would overall kicker scoring be higher or lower?

**Higher.** **1,221** fractional scoring points vs **1,168** standard scoring points.

This is an increase of **53 points** or **4.54%**.

Across the 14-week regular season, the 12 teams in my league scored a total of **24,031.26** points. The 53 point difference only accounts for **0.22%** of total points scored. Pretty insignificant from a data perspective.


#### Are there some kickers who are better suited for either scoring system?

**Yes**. Kickers with big legs<small>*â€”cough Aubreyâ€”*</small>benefited the most from fractional scoring.

#### How well did each team in the league adjust to the new scoring?

Some better than others. The answer to the previous question had a lot to do with this one.

My team, in particular, suffered the most from fractional scoring. More on that below.

## Analysis

### Field Goal Yards

![Bar chat showing standard vs fractional scoring for field goal yard groups](@/content/posts/standard-vs-fractional-kicker-scoring/chart-fg-yard-group-points.png)

With fractional scoring, overall points decreased for all kicks in the 0-29 yard range and increased for all kicks in the 30-50+ yard range.


![Bar chart showing the point difference as a percentage for field goal yard groups](@/content/posts/standard-vs-fractional-kicker-scoring/chart-fg-yard-group-difference.png)

The 20-29 yard field goals suffered the most, losing **37%** of their points. Surprisingly, the 30-39 group saw the biggest gains with an increase of 14%, while the 50+ group saw the smallest positive increase of **6%**.

Outside of the two 0-19 yard field goals, the spread across the remaining groups was closer than I expected, with the biggest slice of the pie going to the 30-39 yard field goals.

### Kickers

Some clear winners and losers here, but I'm not sure how much of a difference **9** or **-1.9** points makes to a given team over the course of a season.

When you include the amount of games played in the graph there's two kickers who stand out the most. Will Lutz with only 7 games played had the third biggest point increase of **6.1** and Jake Moody with 10 games played had the overall worst point decrease of **-1.9**.

### Teams

![Bar chart showing point difference for all 12 teams](@/content/posts/standard-vs-fractional-kicker-scoring/chart-team-point-difference.png)

As I mentioned above in the initial questions, my team (**Team 1**) sufferred the worst throughout the season, primarily because I started the kicker with the largest negative impact, **Jake Moody**. **Team 12** gained the most by rostering **Aubrey**.

But again, we're only talking a swing of **12.1** points over the entire season. These point differences represent only a **0.41%** increase in total points for Team 12 and a decrease of **-0.15%** for my team, Team 1.

Something I did not do is go back to see if fractional vs. standard scoring made the difference in any matchups throughout the season.

## Source Data

I had to write some pretty janky code to hit the [Yahoo Fantasy API](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/) and pull data from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/). I then did some data wrangling in SQLite to get this usable dataset. I've also anonymized the team names from my league.

The full dataset is available as a [CSV on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/johnzanussi/d73e96cd1978b778e46e481738330be0) and as a [spreadsheet on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-x2WgvgNa-vd0z2psqc8xXnknZeJhzHLeMAChDepfVQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Conclusion

While my sample size is relatively small, I wouldn't expect a huge increase in points in your league by switching from standard to fractional kicker scoring. As seen above, the difference is insignificant compared to total points scored across the leagueâ€”especially when compared to scoring changes like switching from standard to PPR or adding points-per-first down. However, I doubt my league will go back to standard kicker scoring, and I don't anticipate reanalyzing this data again after future seasons.

Let me know in the comments if you come up with any other findings, and I'll include them in this post.
