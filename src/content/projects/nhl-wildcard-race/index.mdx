As the NHL season was winding down, several teams were battling for the final two wildcard playoff spots in each conference. Reddit user r/Sarke1 had created a visual breakdown of the wildcard race and shared it on [r/hockey](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1jn7rlh/wildcard_races_mar_29/). I thought it was a great idea and decided to build a site that could update automatically as games were completed.

The site is completely static, only pulling data from the NHL API at build time. A GitHub Action runs every 5 minutes to check the scoreboard and triggers a new build if a game has recently ended.

Once the regular season ended, I turned off the GitHub Action, but I plan to start it up again next season.
