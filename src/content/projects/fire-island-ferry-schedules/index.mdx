I purchased `fireislandferryschedules.com` back in August 2015 with the intention of building a website that would let people easily search the schedules for the various Fire Island ferries. If you're not familiar, [the schedules](https://fimedia.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/16MAY25-19JUN25-MainTerminal-WEBv4-12MAY25.pdf) are published every few months in PDF format and can be super confusing to figure out.

Every year I told myself I'd build a website, but then summer would come and go, and I'd never get around to it. In May 2025, almost 10 years later, I finally got around to it.

Instead of a website, I decided to take the opportunity to create my first iOS app. I'd been meaning to learn React Native for a while, and this project was the perfect excuse to do so. It also gave me a chance to experiment with Cursor and see how much AI could help with development. While it provided a helpful starting point, I ended up rewriting a lot of the code myself.

I manually converted PDF schedules for three main terminals and fourteen Fire Island communities into a more structured format. As of right now (with schedules through September 2025), the database has over 24,000 rows of schedule data. 

The app downloads all the schedules from a remote database and stores them locally on each user's device. This allows for completely offline searching, which is a huge win given the sometimes spotty cell service on Fire Island.

I had a ton of fun building this and learning the ins and outs of shipping an iOS app. I plan to keep improving it over the summer. Expect a more detailed post about the process in the future.
