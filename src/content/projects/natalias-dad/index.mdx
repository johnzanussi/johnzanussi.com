I had the opportunity to speak to my daughter's 2nd-grade class during Career Week about being a Software Engineering Manager. Explaining the world of software to a group of 7-year-olds was quite a challenge, but I tried to make it as fun as possible. I used Reveal.js to create a 15-slide presentation which I shared with the class. After the presentation, I asked each student to come up and type in their name, favorite color, animal, and emoji into the code of a website I created with Astro.
