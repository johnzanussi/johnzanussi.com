## Personal

I’ve always been a tinkerer. Since I was young, I’ve always been interested in how things work. I am constantly learning and enjoy the process of starting something new and the journey to completion.

I am in my mid-30s and have been married to my high school sweetheart for eight years. We have a wonderful four-year-old who shares my love for understanding how things work.

As one would guess, I have many hobbies. I grew up on the ocean and have an affinity for water. Surfing, swimming, fishing, and boating are things I can’t live without.

## Professional

I'm a self-taught front-end web developer and have held many roles since starting in 2006. Since then, I’ve worked up and down the stack. For the past eight years, I’ve either been leading teams or managing people. I don’t write much code these days, but I do truly enjoy supporting other engineers on their career paths.
