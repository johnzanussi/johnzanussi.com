## Personal

Since I was young, I've always been interested in how things work. I enjoy the learning process and the excitement of starting something new and experiencing the journey to completion.

I am in my mid-30s and have been married to my high school sweetheart for some time. We have an incredible five-year-old who shares my love for understanding how things work.

I grew up on the ocean and have had an affinity for water since a young age. We spend a lot of our time in the summer and away on vacation in the winter at beaches. In addition, I spend my free time dabbling in the following hobbies or rooting for my favorite sports teams.

## Professional

I'm a self-taught front-end web developer and have held many roles since starting in 2006. Since then, I've worked up and down the stack. I've been leading teams or managing people since 2014. I genuinely enjoy supporting other engineers' success in their day-to-day and long-term career paths.
