                . I guess you could say I‚Äôm like a car mechanic who drives a
                piece of junk clunker. I‚Äôve been building stuff on the web on my
                own or with teams for the last 15+ years but never had a nice
                personal website. This is my solution to that.

            <p className="lead">
                I‚Äôve been doing a lot of DIY 3D printing and LED projects and
                wanted a place to share my experiences with the community.
                Creating this site is also an excuse to get my hands on coding
                again as a developer and try out the new hotness in web
                technology.
